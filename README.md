# Mona Avatar Gater

Mona Avatar Gater is a prototype to token gate avatars based on a user. We currently use the user's IP address to whitelist specific avatars, and then 


Mona Avatar Gater is an app built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The app uses Vercel's KV store to authorize the user's computer IP. Through Unity visual nodes, the app requests authorized avatars for the user's IP and displays them as VRM switchers in the demo world.
